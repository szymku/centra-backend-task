# Notes

### Plan
1. Create repo in Gitlab or Github.
2. Prepare docker environment.
3. Run original code:
    - add .env
4. Refactor.
5. Run some server - digital ocean maybe.

### Questions and doubts
1. What is github kanban board?
2. Github CI. How to work with?
3. DI it or not.
4. Github oauth:
  - login/logout - logout is needed?
5. Env management.
6. Phpspec or phpunit.
7. Static fixer.
8. Maybe use VO?
